        <pre>
        Three years of love, across miles,
        We made it last in our hearts' aisles.
        Every day, my love grows more,
        Like a river that flows on shore.
            
        Your voice is my sweetest song,
        In my heart, you belong.
        Baymax by my side, you're here,
        Wiping away doubt and fear.
            
        Tulips bloom, a vibrant hue,
        Pink petals, love pure and true.
        Distance keeps us worlds apart,
        Yet you're always in my heart.
            
        A plushie, soft and warm to touch,
        Holds my love, it means so much.
        Promise ring, a symbol true,
        I'll forever belong to you.
            
        In the Mall of Asia's grandeur,
        We'll share a love, strong and sure.
        Chocolate sweet, a shared delight,
        Savoring love, day and night.
            
        A coloring book of memories bright,
        Each page a day, a cherished sight.
        Through crayon strokes and laughter's hook,
        We'll paint a future, an open book.
            
        We've painted memories, vivid and grand,
        Love that's one of a kind, forever to stand.
        Each moment, treasured, like pages anew,
        In this coloring book, it's me and you.
            
        Your laughter, a melody's grace,
        Brings a smile to my face.
        With Baymax close, our hearts entwined,
        Comfort and love, forever aligned.
            
        Under tulip skies, pink and serene,
        With a promise ring, our hearts convene.
        In plushie hugs, we find our delight,
        Love's warmth glowing, day and night.
            
        In the Mall of Asia, hand in hand,
        We'll wander through love's endless strand.
        Sharing chocolates, our hearts taking flight,
        Wrapped in the colors of our affectionate light.
            
        So here's to us, in shades of love true,
        With every stroke, our connection renew.
        In this coloring book, our story's told,
        A tale of love, in vibrant hues, bold.
            
        Though gifts may be beyond my reach,
        Know my love is a promise to teach.
        In time, I'll give you everything, dear,
        A future together, crystal clear.

        With every sunrise, with every dawn,
        I'll work towards a love reborn.
        In the years ahead, you'll see,
        All the treasures meant to be.

        Miles apart, hearts entwined,
        Love grows, spaces undefined.
        Long distance, but we bind,
        In every beat, your love I find.

        No grand celebration's trace,
        Yet with you, my heart finds its place.
        In your eyes, I see my grace,
        You're my dream, my life's embrace.

        This poem might be a little cliche,
        But my love for you won't sway.
        You're my sunshine, come what may,
        Happy anniversary, forever and a day.
